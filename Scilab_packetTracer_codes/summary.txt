practical 1:sin and cos wave generator:
 two methods:
1.by coding
2.by xcos

here we need to supply three main parameters mainly required
1.amplitude::: max. pic to pic value your signal can get
2.frequency::: cycles per second for your periodic signal.
3.phase::: initial position of your signal w.r.to 0 i.e. from which position your signal starts

practical 2:composite signals:
suppose x is sin and y is cosine signal , so we can combine them to get a composite signal.
we can find different harmonics of that perticular composite.
 
z=x+y
plot(z)

practical 3: fft,ifft,fftshift
fft will give you the fourier transform form of data signal, ie frequency domain representation
ifft will invert the above process, i.e if sender uses fft then receiver uses ifft to bring the original signal back.
fftshift simply shifts the referenece.
